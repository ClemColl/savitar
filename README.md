# Context

This app can be tested [live](https://savitarapp.herokuapp.com/)!
This is a prototype built within 2 days. It was used by a student to illustrate his master thesis.
I built a small AI that gives advice after your send a form. Here were the main objectives:

* Create an AI that gives advice based on answers sent.

* Integrate a graph to make it more appealing

* Build all of this working within 3 to 5 days (Finalized in only 2 days, yay)

# Stack used

* Ruby on Rails
  * ChartJS gem
  * Simple Form
* PostgreSQL

* Puma

* Heroku

* Git

# Concept

After sending the form, you get a graph and action plans on where you can improve your business.

# Observations

It was a very close timeline and I've never thought about making an AI before. While it isn't as tech savy as machine learning or using a neural network, it was still a massive work to translate a very detailed paper to a functionning app!
